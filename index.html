        <h3> This is my friend in England's hedgehog. His name is Woody. He's a European Hedgehog. Those are only legal to keep as pets when they are disabled in the U.K. and are illegal in the United States. Woody is blind. </h3>

        <h3> This is a Lesser Tenrec. They are not technically related to hedgehogs but are a big part of the hedgehog community despite this and look quite similar</h3>
        <br>
        <h3> There are many other types of hedgehogs in the world but these are the ones I regularly take interest in my life. </h3>
        <br>
        <h3> An interesting evolutionary phenomenon is that some sort of spikey animal can be found on all continents and in the ocean. Whether it be a porcupine, sea urchin, Echidna, or a multiple of others, all kinds of animals find spikes to be a natural protectant against predators.</h3>
